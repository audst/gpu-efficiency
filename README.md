# GPU Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes the **energy efficiency of GPUs** and their implications for the **sustainability of machine learning workloads**.  
Using datasets such as **Green500**, **MLPerf benchmarks**, and GPU specification data, I forecast energy consumption trends and compute **performance-per-watt** across GPU generations.

This project complements my rainfall forecasting work by addressing the **computational costs of AI** â€” highlighting the connection between **ML systems, sustainability, and climate impact**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Build a dataset combining GPU specs, performance, and power consumption.  
- Forecast trends in **performance-per-watt** across generations.  
- Convert GPU energy usage into **COâ‚‚ emission equivalents**.  
- Deploy a **dashboard** to visualize efficiency and sustainability metrics.  
- Connect results to **Green AI** research and policy discussions.
